# TCC_EMG
Completion of course work - Recognition of and movements by machine learning using surface electromyography

This repository contains the codes used for my undergraduation completion of course. 

## Setting up

Follow instructions for environment setup [here](./environment/README.md)

## Running

First run the scripts at [WindowGen notebook](./notebooks/dataset/WindowGen.ipynb). This scripts assumes that the .zip files from [NinaPro DB2](http://ninapro.hevs.ch/) are at DATA_PATH (you will need to change this variable to your directory that contains those files). This notebook will read those files, do the preprocessing and save the windowed data (also need to change the save folders).

Now run the scripts at [FeatureExtraction notebook](./notebooks/dataset/FeatureExtraction.ipynb). This scripts will read the files generated by the last notebook, will process them and save the generated features.

## Experiments

The [experiments](./notebooks/experiments) folder contains the experiments done that were reported.

## Utils

* [Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* [Keras documentation](http://keras.io)


### TODO

* Remove code from experiments, notebooks (use [algorithms.py](algorithms.py)).
* Improve documentation of codes.
